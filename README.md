# sentiment-analysis-bert
This project demonstrates how to perform sentiment analysis using BERT, a state-of-the-art language model for natural language processing. The repository includes code for data preprocessing, loading a pretrained BERT model, and fine-tuning it for sentiment classification. It is tailored for intermediate Python users with experience in libraries such as NumPy, Pandas, and PyTorch. The project leverages a cloud-based environment to provide practical, hands-on experience in implementing machine learning solutions for text data.
